Hey guyyyys! My name's Calvare, and I LOVE making videos that combine my biggest passions: **Minecraft**, **YouTube**, **music**, and SOMETIMES **scratch**.

## Minecraft!

I love minecraft, if you can't tell from my channel... It all started when I was 3 and I was restricted and supervised on my dad's ipad with heavy restrictions. "(I'm not brainrotted I swear...)" I was in a superflat world and it was raining, it was pretty much OG pocket edition. When I turned four I had a rasperry PI, I was into tech pretty young. Me and my family "(along with my twin sister)" would play Rasperry PI minecraft edition. I remember breaking the fence beetween her rabbits and my dogs to troll her. I eventually when I was four got java on my moms computer. I then joined a server called autcraft at five years old. This introduced me with more survival. I remember having minecraft realms and being surprised when the texture update came out. I'd apply programmer art out of confusion to make it feel familiar. I then at age 12 created my youtube channel. Started playing bedwars and PVP in 2021, I had minecraft command expirience since I was 7, so I'm good at that.


## YouTube Channel: @calvare16

On my YouTube channel ([youtube.com/@calvare16](https://youtube.com/@calvare16)), I play Minecraft, share music, sometimes just make misc videos, lots of random things. 

## Music: Midnight Songs

I make music, I played a piano when I was four and never left. I'm scared now because of SUNO and other ai's that just remove all my talent in an instant, but oh well. At least I tried! On my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/midnightsongs), I share kinda trash music. I really love music, it's so cool to eventually see your work transform into something more. It's a beautiful thing. I love breakcore with calm piano, complex melodies or deep tracks, melancholic .etc. I was inspired by Toby Fox so heavily after playing Undertale, in deltarune chapter 4 I cried at the music multiple times at the obsurd complexity of the track. 3rd Sanctuary ("I think that's what it was") has an insane time signature, LISTEN TO IT.

## Creative Coding on Scratch

I also used to love making projects on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Calvare). I kinda know nothing about coding except for scratch. I don't use it anymore due to it's terrible moderation, now I use [PenguinMod](https://penguinmod.com)

## My history

Idk I'll talk about it in a vid or smthn

If you see this, sorry.
I'm afraid of the current state of America as of 2025, where I live.
Dictatorship, evil companies spying on your every move. You don't know it. 15 devices are probably watching you right now.
Check TikTok, it saves your EXACT location. Always scroll down before downloading apps and check the privacy, if you see third parties or anything about collecting info it means that's not good. Third parties are when companies sell your info to other people and who knows what they'll do with your info. I don't use lunar client personally because it spys on your TEAMSPEAK, and collects your SEARCH HISTORY. Yet people like Jooonah glaze it. If only he knew. Maybe he does, and he just doesn't care. But the situation is looking bad.
I'm only 13 and afraid for my safety...
